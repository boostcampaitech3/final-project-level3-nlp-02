1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATTENED SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS
1089-134686-0003 HELLO BERTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
